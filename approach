approach to get you started:

1. Start with the HTML and CSS:

   - Create the structure of your quiz application using HTML, including elements for the question, options, submit button, and score display.
   - Style your application using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

2. Set up the JavaScript:

   - Create an array or object to store your quiz questions, along with their options and correct answers.
   - Use JavaScript to retrieve and display the first question on the page.

3. Build the functionality:

   - Implement JavaScript logic to handle user interactions, such as selecting an answer and submitting it.
   - Validate the selected answer and provide immediate feedback to the user.
   - Update the score based on the correctness of the answer.
   - Move to the next question after the user submits their answer.

4. Iterate and improve:
   - Test your quiz application thoroughly, making sure all the functionalities work as expected.
   - Refactor your code if needed and look for opportunities to optimize it.
   - Consider adding additional features or enhancements, such as a timer, progress indicator, or saving high scores.

Remember to approach the project one step at a time, focusing on completing each task before moving on to the next. Utilize online resources, tutorials, and documentation to guide you through the specific implementations you may be unsure about.

Building the quiz application will challenge you and provide valuable hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will also serve as an excellent opportunity to learn and grow your skills. Enjoy the process, and don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification when needed. Good luck with your project!
